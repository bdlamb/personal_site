            To Whom It May Concern, </br> 
            I’m happy to write this letter of recommendation for Brian Lamb, who worked with me as a 
            Software Developer at EventBuilder. </br> 
            From the very start, Brian stood out as someone with a real drive to learn and grow. When 
            he joined us, he had limited experience with some of the languages and tools we used, but 
            that never slowed him down. He picked things up quickly, asked great questions, and 
            before long, he was contributing at the same level as more experienced developers on the 
            team. </br> 
            Brian is a quick learner, a strong problem solver, and someone who takes ownership of his 
            work. He doesn’t shy away from challenges — instead, he dives in, figures things out, and 
            often finds better ways to do them. Beyond his technical skills, Brian is simply a great 
            person to work with: reliable, curious, and always positive. </br> 
            Unfortunately, we had to make some difficult cuts, and Brian’s role was affected. That 
            decision had nothing to do with his performance, which was excellent in every way. I have 
            no doubt he’ll continue to excel wherever he goes next, and any team would be lucky to 
            have him. </br> 
            If you’d like to chat more about Brian’s work with us, I’d be happy to share more details. You 
            can reach me at david.lamb@eventbuilder.com or 360-936-5945. </br> 
            Sincerely, </br> 
            David E. Lamb Jr. </br> 
            Director of Technology, EventBuilder </br>
