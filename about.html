            <h2>A short Summary</h2>
            <p> &emsp;&emsp;I have been into video games from a young age when my dad bought a sega. Once i played my first game on that i was addicted. It was from my gaming experience that i got into programming. I had the grand idea of creating games, like so many gamers. 
                So, to help me with that i got a BS in Computer Science. But, my shyness, anxiety and limited life skills did not help me succeed. I could not get myself into a programming job at that time. 
                So, instead i played around with programming on my own. I dabbled in html, css and javascript creating a simple little online game. I then moved on to learning java for both the pc and the android version creating another game. 
                These where both simple and the graphics and interactions where crude, but it was fun to do. Made no money during that time and i eventually moved away from programming for awhile. I did some customer IT and assembly work for awhile. 
                In that time things happened and i ended up losing all my code for those projects. It was a sad day. I eventually got back into programing when i got a job for eventbuilder. There i worked on a web based app in javascript. 
                That was fun

                        <p>My favorite type of game is RPG. I like that there are many hours you can spend playing these type 
                        as well as the ability to explore to my hearts content. The interesting stories and
                        the ability to customize my characters are also things i like. My favorite game of all time was
                        the first RPG game i ever played. It was called Land Stalker and it was on the Sega. The
                        main game i play nowadays is World of Warcraft.

                        <p>I do love a good anime even though i find it hard to find new series that i would like.
                        Like everyone in my age group i first started off with your typical morning cartoons on tv. Shows
                        like x-men,ninja turtles,GiJoe. From those i eventally discovered anime like yu-gi-oh, dragon ball and naruto and my love for anime grew.
                        I like action based anime that resove around martial arts, sword play, ninjas and medieval themed. Currently i am watching
                        One Piece(caught up), Gachiakuto and tougen anki. My Favorite anime would have to 
                        Bleach. Sadley i have only watched the original series, not the Thousand Year War. They 
                        do not have that on Crunchyroll.

                        <p>I do enjoy listening to music when i can. I listen to wide range of songs but i think for the most
                        part most of the songs i listen to would be in the pop,rock and country areas. My tastes
                        are not just english songs. I have found Gaelic songs i have liked and Japanese.
                        I would have to admit anime had got me on a bit of JPOP vibe. Hear an awsome intro or ending song
                        and i run to youtube to find the full thing. I would say that i do not have a favorite band.

                        <p>I am not sure what caused this obsession to start but i have over the last few years
                        gotten the desire to obtained signed items and action figures. Weirdly i think it started out with me collecting JPOP items from the bands i heard in the animes. I think i have maby a dozen signed posters, a dozen signed
                        cds, some signed pictures and now few action figures. ITs becoming an issue.
