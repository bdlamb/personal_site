                <p class="more-text">&emsp;&emsp; Well, this was a great experience. My re-awaking in programming. It was a pleasure to work with the company and it's employees.I was happy they where willing to take in a pretty green programmer and show me a bit of the ropes in real life programming.
                    I was able to build a bit upon my javascript, html, and css self education to a real project. In that time a pick up some experience
                    programming in node. Along with that i got some experience using git integrated with visual studio code. I think most of
                    my work was around bug fixes, graphic/text fixes and slight alteration to existing elements. But i also got to add some new elements
                    to the code, which i hope will continue to be used and improved on. I will not really go into what the do. If your interested there is a link
                    bellow to their site. I suggest you check them out. Its a great company. While there i got work under David Lamb Jr. Yes we are related how do
                    you think i was able to get that job. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-lamb-jr-bb678920/">His linkedin</a>

                <p class="more-text">&emsp;&emsp;Another fun experience. First off i did not work directly for intel. I was contact employee for Kelly Services that worked for intel. Originally i was a bit hesitant about accepting the job as it was located in Hillsboro and i live in Vancouver. 
                    So, its a long trip by car even longer when you use the bus like i do. Two hour trips one way, what i pain. But, i got to do something else i enjoy doing, building computers. I got to put parts in servers and NUCs as well, which was quite new to me. My fellow employees where awesome. I also had a great supervisor chaz.

                <p class="more-text">&emsp;&emsp;Well this was a very interesting job. As what i would consider my first real job experience i got experience quite a bit of firsts. So being out of a job for a fellow
                    months and doing my first go at job hunting, i was a bit intrigued when i say the job posting. I applied and i swear within a few  hours i go a call back. The job
                    posting was a temp job, through Kelly my first experience with a temp agency but that was fine. I got to go the typical pre-hiring stuff and in a few days the called me back.
                    It was a very interesting start. I got the call on Friday and was told my first day was Monday. That i first found interesting, no interview, that is weird, but okay. At that time had a cold so i started to freak out a little bit, still covid time.
                    I was like i can not go to work on my first day sick and i can not really call out sick on first day that would look bad. Luckily by Sunday, my cold was gone and i was fine. And i went to work.
                    In my time there i got to see a work location basically get brought up, going though all its growing pains. I was not hired on the start of the location but i was pretty close i think.
                    If i recall the location had been there for 3-4 months before i started. I got to see the location go from temp location to its actual location and got to help somewhat with the \
                    transition. Off the start, the there not a lot of procedure, routines or guidelines set up. But, i got to witness all of those eventually into in reality. Know for the work.
                    I will not explain to much about what we built, as i signed an NDA in regards to that. Side note, NDAs are quite annoying. Your sign them promising not to say anything tell its okay 
                    to talk, but you never actually told when you can talk about. Do i have to guess? Anyways, back to the job. We where basically putting together some VR glasses. I got to 
                    put the components together, using screws and adhesives. Got to connect circuit borders together by connecting plugs. I also was involved in testing the components at different stages, from just the individual parts to the finished product.
                    It was great. I also had to go through the fun of training new employees. My fellow employees where great and i had the best supervisor, Josh. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-rongone/">Linked in.</a>

                <p class="more-text">&emsp;&emsp; So this one. Before i got this job, i was not working. I was learning an missing around with programing languages on my own. I had a great dad, who supported me during that time. Eventually life hit me and i realized i was not getting any money doing this and i need to make a change.
                    My dad got into a partnership and was part owner of a computer shop in Washougal called Silver Star computers and he offered to let me work there. Now this was quite a change. My education and experience was in programming, not in computer hardware or repair. I had not even built my first computer by then. I was and still am
                    a shy, introvert, with anxiety(both normal and social) to the point that my brain would just shut down when dealing with people. And here i was no idea what to do thrown into a job where i am expected to deal with people. It was not easy job and i stubbled the whole time. In my time there handled a lot of what you expect a person 
                    in a computer shop to do. I checked in and checked out customer computers. I handled the sales of items. I answered the phone. I did some of the repair work, learning what i needed along the way. I did virus removal, blue screen/shut down troubleshooting, computer clean ups, replaced/upgraded components, installed OS, data recovery, etc.  
                    I got experience creating and updating work tickets, don't remember what the application was. I got to use a program called parted magic a lot, we used this to check drives, recover data and clone. For data recovery i later moved on to using Minitool Partition Wizard wizard as it was easier to use. WE used quite a few anti-virus 
                    to clean up computers including a free open source one called Clamwin. Eventually i got to the point where i was also opening and closing the store when needed. Sadly my dad passed away suddenly. As a result the company sold to another gentlemen who kept the business but rebranded it as Silver Star Technologies. He kept me on and under him 
                    i did the same stuff as before. Sadly a combination of things lead to bad business and the owner closed the shop down. To me this time i would say is a bit of a mess. I learned a lot, i am able to handle the customer interactions a bit easier. But it was a stressful time having all the anxiety flowing through me all day. Just not a people person, 
                    and i sill not. Then losing my dad at the same time. Yea.

                <p>&emsp;&emsp;The company was located in washougal next to Highway fuel.Not sure if the building ever sold but if you looking for shop in washougal i would take a look at it.
                    The last owner remodled the whole building near the end and we where not in the new building very long before it shut down. So it should be in great shape.
